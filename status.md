The following issues are known since the cybercrisis, we are working on a full architecture change to allow this again. Hopefully before the next academic year.

- **Mail not reachable off campus via mail clients:**
To access the email, either use the EduVPN, or use the [webmail client](https://webmail.gewis.nl/).

- **Various website might return "Web page blocked!" with a red cross next to it**: This is known, but mostly out of our hands

- **VPN for graduates not reachable:** Unfortunately, nothing we can do about this.
