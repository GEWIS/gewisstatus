## Longer-term known issues
The following issues are known since the cybercrisis, please see [this GMM letter](https://gewis.nl/en/decision/document/2068) for more information. Since this letter, we have communicated with LIS and are working on a full architecture change to allow this again. Hopefully before the next academic year. 

- **Mail not reachable off campus via mail clients:**
To access the email, either use the EduVPN, or use the [webmail client](https://webmail.gewis.nl/).

- **Various website might return "Web page blocked!" with a red cross next to it**: This is known, but mostly out of our hands

- **VPN/vdesktop for graduates not reachable:** Unfortunately, nothing we can do about this.

- **Receiving email on custom domains:** Besides @gewis.nl, @gehack.nl, and @barcommissie.nl, other custom email domain aliases - usually from fraternities and boards - do not work anymore. Again, there is nothing we can do about this.
